   # ðŸ”¸ 1. What is Lazy Loading in React?
     Lazy Loading in React means loading components only when they are needed, rather than loading everything at once when the app starts. This improves performance, especially for large applications.



   # ðŸ”¸ 3. Why Use <Suspense>?
    Since React.lazy() loads components asynchronously, React needs to know what to show while it's loading. Thatâ€™s where <Suspense> comes in.
