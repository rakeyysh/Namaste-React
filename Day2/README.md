# Parcel

# - 📦 Parcel (Bundler)
What it does:
Parcel is a zero-config web application bundler that takes your code (HTML, JS, CSS, etc.) and bundles it into optimized files for the browser.

- Core points:

- Automatically handles bundling, transpiling, minifying.



      Your Code + Dependencies (node_modules)

- Remove main : "App.js" from package.json

- In a Node.js project or bundler config (like with Parcel), the "main" field specifies the entry point of your package – the JavaScript file that should be loaded when someone imports your package using:

- require('your-package')  // or
- import 'your-package'


- # 🤔 So, Why Remove the "main" Key?
✅ 1. Parcel Automatically Handles Entry Points
Parcel doesn’t need a main field unless you're publishing a library to npm.

If you're just building a frontend app (like React, HTML/CSS/JS app), Parcel determines the entry point based on the CLI or the HTML file you provide.

- parcel index.html




# What is dist folder?

- The dist folder (short for distribution) is a build output directory. It contains the final version of your code that is ready to be deployed, served, or published.

- The dist folder usually contains minified and optimized files only when you build your project for production.
- You are telling Parcel to create a production build of index.html.
   npx parcel build index.html

- to create a Devlopment build
   npx parcel index.html


- The files like dist, .parcel-cache, node-modules can be regenerated by writing production build or development build , so no need to 
- push on github just add it to .gitignore


- # 🌐 What is browserslist?
   browserslist is a configuration tool used to specify which browsers your project should support.
   It's used by build tools like:

   ✅ Parcel

   ✅ Autoprefixer (PostCSS plugin)

   ✅ Babel

   ✅ ESLint (with plugins)



  - # 🌲 What is Tree Shaking? ( Feature of Parcel)
  -    Tree shaking is a build optimization technique that removes dead (unused) code from your JavaScript bundles.


- # 🧩 1. Bundling
What is it?
Bundling is the process of combining many JavaScript (or other) files into one or a few files.

Why it's done:

- Browsers make limited HTTP requests at once. Fewer files = faster loading.
-Keeps dependencies in one place.


- # 🔁 2. Transpiling
What is it?
Transpiling means converting modern JavaScript (or TypeScript) into older JavaScript that works on all browsers.

Why it's done:

- Not all browsers support modern syntax (like ES6+).
- Tools like Babel convert code to be backward-compatible.


- # 🔬 3. Minifying 
What is it?
- Minifying removes unnecessary characters (like spaces, new lines, comments) from your code to reduce
