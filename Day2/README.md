- Remove main : "App.js" from package.json

- In a Node.js project or bundler config (like with Parcel), the "main" field specifies the entry point of your package ‚Äì the JavaScript file that should be loaded when someone imports your package using:

- require('your-package')  // or
- import 'your-package'

- ü§î So, Why Remove the "main" Key?
‚úÖ 1. Parcel Automatically Handles Entry Points
Parcel doesn‚Äôt need a main field unless you're publishing a library to npm.

If you're just building a frontend app (like React, HTML/CSS/JS app), Parcel determines the entry point based on the CLI or the HTML file you provide.

- parcel index.html






- The dist folder (short for distribution) is a build output directory. It contains the final version of your code that is ready to be deployed, served, or published.

- The dist folder usually contains minified and optimized files only when you build your project for production.
- You are telling Parcel to create a production build of index.html.
   npx parcel build index.html

- to create a Devlopment build
   npx parcel index.html

- The files like dist, .parcel-cache, node-modules can be regenerated by writing production build or development build , so no need to 
- push on github just add it to .gitignore

-  üåê What is browserslist?
   browserslist is a configuration tool used to specify which browsers your project should support.
   It's used by build tools like:

   ‚úÖ Parcel

   ‚úÖ Autoprefixer (PostCSS plugin)

   ‚úÖ Babel

   ‚úÖ ESLint (with plugins)



  - üå≤ What is Tree Shaking? ( Feature of Parcel)
  -    Tree shaking is a build optimization technique that removes dead (unused) code from your JavaScript bundles.


  - ‚öôÔ∏è How Tree Shaking Works
    Tree shaking happens at build time and relies on:

    ES6 Module Syntax (import / export)

    A JavaScript bundler like:

      Parcel ‚úÖ

      Webpack ‚úÖ

      Rollup ‚úÖ

      Vite ‚úÖ
