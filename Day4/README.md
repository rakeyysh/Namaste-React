- # ðŸ”‘ Purpose of key in JSX:
React uses the key (usually with .map()) to identify which items in a list have changed, been added, or been removed. This helps React minimize re-renders and improve performance during updates. other-wise it will re -render everything if any list have been changed .

- We donâ€™t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change.

- not using keys(not acceptable) <<<< index as key (not best practice /good)    <<<< unique id (best practice) >>>>>>>>
